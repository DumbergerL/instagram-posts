                    "Thinking about my highlights of this year, and New York was definitely one of them. Another was releasing @filmmapp with @abeautifulmess (@elsielarson & @emmaredvelvet) & then yesterday releasing our second app @templateapp with the same incredible team! It\u2019s available to download now and has everything you\u2019d ever need to get creative with your video and images! (Link is in my bio or on my stories at time of posting this) I\u2019ve already seen so many amazing collages created with the app & we\u2019re all so grateful for your fabulous feedback so far \ud83d\udcab .\n.\n.\nAnd as I\u2019m anticipating a lot of questions about it, for the android users, the team are focusing all their efforts in completing the long awaited filmm release before looking into doing Template! Building for android is a much more lengthy process, but we\u2019re not far away from launching filmm for Android now! \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffc",

The goal for Filmm was always to be able to film videos on your phone, use amazing filters and effects and then create an entire video within the app itself. The ability to put clips together along with a whole load of amazing transitions is NOW AVAILABLE in the app! (As well as still being able to edit single videos too). I edited this entire video on my phone just using @filmmapp! Last week it reached 1 million downloads and it makes me so happy to see so many of you creating beautiful videos with it, thank you so much for all the support! I feel like this is going to step up my Instagram video game (and it\u2019s just so bloomin\u2019 easy to use). For all the android users out there, fear not, it\u2019s looking likely that filmm will be released in January but will keep you updated! It\u2019s been a much harder process than it was for IOS so the team are working super hard to get it all done for you! \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffc",

You can do it many different ways and there are many variations on this dish depending on where in the world you come from. There are a few vegetables you can use to make this dish, my family will often use zucchini (courgette), tomato, capsicum or eggplant (aubergine). The key to ensuring the vegetables don't dry out in the oven is to tip a cup of water in the oven tray with your veg. This is a great, well-rounded dish for any vegetarians or vegans too, full of rice and other healthy, hearty ingredients, plus you can season it to your tastes with any herbs and spices you like!!\u2063\n\u2063\nPhoto credit: @rebelrecipes",

Maybe you want to to try out a new buttercream recipe, try making your own fondant, or even try tackling that cake bucket list of yours?? I'd love to hear your goals!\u2060\n\u2060\n\u2060\nPersonally I\u2019d love to write another book because I had so much fun creating my first cakebook\u2026 hopefully I have enough time in 2020 or it may just be a decade resolution which is cool too! Either way, I\u2019m super excited to see what the year will bring \ud83e\udd70 Check out my new SxS comp with caked up new years\u2019 resolutions!! \ud83c\udf1f link in bio \ud83c\udf1f\u2060\n- \u2060\n- \u2060\n- \u2060\n- \u2060\nReady to improve your baking in 2020?

                    "Can we just take a moment to reflect on the fact that it\u2019s about to be 2020\u2026 Like what?! We\u2019re not just talking New YEAR resolutions anymore, we\u2019re talking New DECADE resolutions \ud83e\udd2f Whether you want to work out, read, or travel more, these cakes are the perfect reminder of your goals! OR better yet, if your resolution is to bake more\u2026 you can just bake all of your other resolutions and cross them off the list \ud83e\udd2a (take in that luggage cake is filled with chocolate and white chocolate buttercream\u2026 \ud83e\udd24) Check it out now \ud83c\udf1f link in bio \ud83c\udf1f\u2060\n- \u2060\n- \u2060\n- \u2060\n- \u2060\nReady to improve your baking in 2020?

                    "Cake Moment #2: Surprise Sprinkles!\u2060\n\u2060\nOkay slicing into a cake is already so satisfying but when there are surprise sprinkles?? Well that just takes the cake! \ud83d\ude05\u2060\n\u2060\nTo create these sprinkled up secret chambers, I began by using circle cutters (which you can find on @howtocakeit) to cut out an even hole from the center of each cake layer. After stacking my cakes up (with buttercream), I then fill the secret chamber with sprinkles - but you can really fill it with any fun surprise! Once your chamber is full, add a final layer of cake on top with no hole in and voila! You have a cake with a fun secret chamber. This is an awesome way to add some extra fun to literally any cake \ud83d\ude0a Have you guys tried making secret chambers before? What did you fill them up with? \ud83e\udd14\u2060\n-\u2060\n-\u2060\n-\u2060\nFor more cake fun, check out @howtocakeit\u2060",

So of course my solution is to make them into giant chocolate MEGA cakes!! These chocolate dream cakes are made of chocolate cake (duh), stacked with Swiss meringue buttercream, chocolate ganache, AND caramel but it gets even better\u2026Layered between each layer of cake is all my left over chocolate \ud83e\udd24 How do you like to use leftover chocolate?

This 10 year period has been beyond a dream for me and it's a huge thanks to everyone who has been part of the adventures. Never did I think when I uploaded my first YouTube video in January 2010 that 10 years later I'd be fortunate enough to own these kind of cars and doing things like taking 6 of my cars around Europe on Where's Shmee, to flying my Ford GT over to the USA and travelling across the country. Every year I cannot believe what I've been lucky enough to do and it already looks like the new decade has plenty in store. It's a Happy New Year to everybody and may you have a successful and prosperous 2020! Thank you for your support",

I couldn't have asked for more than the work carried out by @chartwell_derby working with @mclarenauto to get it right through the painstaking process of investigation, parts manufacturing, MSO paintwork, assembly, calibration and ultimately shakedown. Of course for the collection day it had to be the matching G63 in action with @turbotransport and the trailer. Bring on 2020; better weather and many fun adventures and drives ahead in the Senna!",
                    "Well there wasn't any other way we'd go to collect my Senna, was there?! Taking the G63 with @turbotransport to head up for collection and to bring it back home to the garage.

                    "This was 12 months ago collecting my Senna at @mclarenmanchester which is going to be a deja vu in a few days collecting it again, for the second Christmas in a row! It feels like a brand new addition to @theshmeemobiles all over again",

                    "Getting a taster of the Senna during shakedown reminded me how raw this car actually is! Not long now until it returns to @theshmeemobiles garage, just the final prep and sign-off before the long wait is over. And yes, the size of that wing will never make sense!",

Soon to return to the garage with @theshmeemobiles but first it'll have a full test to run through the paces and ensure everything is correct; from ESC and wing movements to rattles and driving feel. This is carried out by the McLaren team at @millbrook.official using the purpose built facility. You'll notice it is running on temporary silver shakedown wheels fitted with Pzero tyres that are much more appropriate than the track Trofeo R ones on my normal Dark Stealth set. Huge thanks to those who made it possible to join and cover this day!",

All have a big engine up front and could sit comfortable in the sports-GT category, but then we're mixing V8s and V12s, NA and turbo, manual and DCT, RWD and 4WD.
