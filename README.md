# Instagram Posts of Macro-Influencers in December 2019

## Data

The captions of 20 Instagram Influencers were collected manually. Four branches of Influencers were chosen, namely Beauty, Fitness, Food and Technology. From each category five Influencers, male and female, of the Forbes List of Top Influencers 2017 (Forbes 2017) were chosen according to the following two criteria. First, they must be "Macro-Influencers", which means they must have around 1,000,000 followers and are no celebrities outside social media. Second, their primary language must be English. No restriction to British English was made in order to cover a diverse geographic distribution. In this way, it was ensured that the data was not biased due to regional variations of language.

The sample of captions was restricted to posts that were either marked as a collaboration or paid partnership with a brand or captions which either included the hashtag #ad or directly mentioned a product or brand via name tagging (@ sign). Captions were excluded where the name tag led to a related person of the Influencer, such as the partner, a family member or a pet. Captions were collected during the month of December 2019. This month was chosen due to two facts. First, recent research has shown that on weekends, when people do not go to work and sleep more, and during holidays, such as Christmas or New Year's Eve, the emotive content, especially happiness, on social media increases. The sample contained 293 captions with a total of 18,721 words. The average Instagram caption of Influencers working with brands was therefore about 64 words.
